  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>When understanding a new framework I always want to see the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A "brochure" site at the root including "about" *</li>
    <li>Let a user log in</li>
    <li>After login, see some kind of dashboard</li>
    <li>Let the user log out, and see that the dashboard is no longer accessible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How did I get here?</h2>

  <p>I followed these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Build a basic working site with a "pretend" login.
      <ul>
        <li>Read the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html">router guide</a>
        - important because it covers "guarded" routes</li>
        <li>Study the plunkr on the above page. It has a lot going on.</li>
        <li>Start with a new <code>ng-cli</code>-generated project</li>
        <li>Study the plunkr code again and again, re-reading above links, integrating pieces as I went</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Added a basic HTTP service</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I used <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample">this sample service</a>
        which is mentioned in the Medium article below. It's a nice simple way to prove an API call with no auth 
        required, create faux users, authenticate users and prove a restricted API call.</li>
        <li>On the brochure I added callign the unauthenticated API just to prove it works</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Call a (pretend) back-end to authenticate and use JWTs.
      <ul>
        <li>Read 
          <a href="https://medium.com/@blacksonic86/angular-2-authentication-revisited-611bf7373bf9#.b1pldpbd1">
          medium piece on angular with authentication
          </a> with a back-end (albeit a mocked out one)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Call a real back-end to authenticate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>A note about static "brochure" sites</h2>

  <p><strong>* </strong> 
    I'm not saying that static brochure content "should" be provided by an 
    angular site. So far I think a brochure site should be outside of Angular,
    and I'm a fan of Jekyll.</p> 
    
  <p>That said, I think seeing how the non-logged-in part of a site works is a key
    part of understanding a new framework.</p>
